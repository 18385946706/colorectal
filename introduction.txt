 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder（ADHD）, is a common neurodevelopmental issue in childhood. It involves persistent attention deficits and impulsive behavior. Although usually diagnosed in childhood, its effects can last into adolescence and adulthood, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data. Currently, clinical ADHD diagnosis relies on assessments by psychiatric or specialized pediatric professionals, aligning with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria. Early diagnosis provides therapeutic possibilities to improve symptoms in social relationships, attention, and school performance. However, 
 traditional assessments rely on subjective observations, introducing potential errors.
